Open-Source (GPL-3) PHP CMS-like project/library focused on database first originally based on drupal.

Instead of building a CMS around PHP, this project aims to build a library around database and then extend it into PHP (and possibly more languages).

Goals of this project:
1) Provide a professional grade open-source project that encourages deviating from core.
2) Build from the database up instead of PHP down.
3) Follow all standards claimed to follow and explicitly communicate all deviations or violations of followed standards.
4) Design in such a way to encourage hacking and personalizing.
5) Provide a consistent coding style and standard.
6) Provide a project not for beginners but instead for intermediate, advanced, and professional level users.
7) Favor read operations at the expense of write operations (an optimization for websites).
