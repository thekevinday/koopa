The following is the URL path naming strategy that I intend to use on my projects.

Paths that begin with the following:
 /a/ = Administrative/Management/Logged-In Paths.
 /c/ = Cache Paths.
 /d/ = Data Paths, such as RSS Feeds.
 /f/ = File Paths.
 /t/ = Theme Paths.
 /u/ = User Paths (similar to /a/, but focused on users or custom user content).
 /x/ = Ajax Paths.

All other paths are assumed to be site specific (making the paths readily available for CMS's and the like).

Example /a/ paths:
- /a/dashboard - Dashboard
- /a/content - Listing of site content.
- /a/logs - Listing of site logs.

Example /c/ paths:
- /c/static/index.html - Static representation of index.html
- /c/error/404.html - Static 404 HTML page.

Example /d/ paths:
- /d/rss/ - RSS Feeds
- /d/ical/ - iCalendar Feeds

Example /f/ paths:
- /f/i/% - Load file '%' by file id.
- /f/c/% - Load file '%' by file checksum.
- /f/s/% - Load checksum for file '%'.

Example /t/ paths:
- /t/main/css/all.css - All css file from main theme.
- /t/alternate/js/slider.js - Slider javascript file from alternate.

Example /u/ paths:
- /u/reset/% - Reset Password for user '%'.
- /u/contact/% - Contact information for user '%'.
- /u/login/% - Login Page for user '%'.

Example /x/ paths:
- /x/login/user_name/% - Ajax Path for searching for a list of users with the data from '%'.
